alignment chart compiler
========================

Because office tools are for normal people and online tools lack flexibility,
here's another tool based on matplotlib,
a certainly future-proof framework for the complex data manipulation that is necessary for this purpose.

Making tools for the simplest things always provides best value `in the long run`__.
Alignment charts are fun so this `almost ready`__ tool will get so much use.
